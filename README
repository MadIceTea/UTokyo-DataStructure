This will be where I place code files that I make (classwork, homework) for this course.

Some assignments and the final project borrow on work I have completed from a previous Android programming project, especially a certain database of Station name byte-codes.

This course is "Database Mangement Systems and Data Structures" - a Friday 3rd course taught by Prof. Yamaguchi for undergraduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. I will be (at minimum) sitting this course so that I can learn basics of C-programming.

All code here (c) Alex Wiegman, Dr. Yoshihiro Kawahara and should not be reproduced in commercial use nor in educational assignments without contacting at least one of the aforementioned people.
