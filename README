This will be where I place code files that I make (classwork, homework) for this course.

This course is "Computer Software I" - a 2-period Thursday 3rd/4th course that is taugh by Prof. Yoshihiro Kawahara for undergraduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. I will be (at minimum) sitting this course so that I can learn basics of C-programming.

It is taught in Room E21, Information Studies Building, The University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus.

All code here (c) Alex Wiegman, Dr. Yoshihiro Kawahara and should not be reproduced in commercial use nor in educational assignments without contacting at least one of the aforementioned people.
